# Core Requirements

## Epic 1: MVP
- **Player Search**
    - As a user, I want to input a Riot ID (composed of IGN + tag) and select a server region. 
    - This will allow me to look up that player.
- **Profile Display**
    - Level of user 
    - Account Level
    - Current rank and LP
    - Show top 3 most played champions (mastery)
- **Match History Display**
    - Previous 5 games (every mode)
## Epic 2: Statefulness + QoL
- **Account Settings**
    - As a user, I want to set a main account that opens up whenever I open the app.
    - As a user, I want the application to remember my previously searched accounts so that I don’t need to type that again.
    - As a user, I want to be able to bookmark specific accounts so that I can have a list of players I track regularly. (folder perhaps? Like Spotify)
    - As a user, I want my server region to default based on my system timezone/language. The tagline should also default to my selected region if left blank, just like the Riot client.
- **Game QoL**
    - As a user, I want to be able to see the historical winrates for each matchup on game load.
## Epic 3: Statistics + Analysis
- **Graphs**
    - As a user, I want to be able to analyse my LP history with a line graph.
    - As a user, I want to be able to select and compare my played champions and see my performance versus a selected division  performance of this champion.
